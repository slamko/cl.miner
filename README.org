*** Bitcoin miner on OpenCL built with "getblocktemplate" protocol

This is mainly an educational project, though contrary to many educational bitcoin miners on github
this one is able (hopefully) to actually mine bitcoins (at least in test mode), as most of the mining
projects in the net focus mainly on the algorithm without implementing Bitcoin's RPC protocol (which is not
that easy to do from scratch). Also it is kinda rare to find a repo using *getblocktemplate* protocol as older
projects stick to legacy *getwork*. Finaly there are a lot of CPU miners examples so this one may be
somewhat more interesting (though obviously it does not offer here "the most optimized GPU algorithm").

*** All in all
This may serve as a reference/ example implementation for:
- *getblocktemplate* protocol
- GPU accelerated mining 
- OpenCL examples somewhat more interesting than basic vector addition.
